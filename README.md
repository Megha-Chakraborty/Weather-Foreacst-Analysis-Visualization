# Weather Forecast Analysis

This Python project provides a comprehensive analysis of weather data from around the world. Using data from various countries, seasons, and months, users can query specific weather conditions and visualize the results. The project leverages the power of `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` to process and display the data.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze weather data from different countries and seasons.
- **Custom Queries**: Input specific queries to get tailored weather insights.
- **Visualizations**: Generate charts and graphs to visualize weather patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```
Usage
Prepare Your Data: Ensure your weather data is in a CSV format. The CSV file should have columns like Country, Season, Month, Temperature, Humidity, etc.

Running the Script:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast-analysis.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd weather-forecast-analysis
```
Run the Python script:
```bash
python weather_analysis.py
```
User Input: The script will prompt you to input your choice of data. You can specify:

Country
Season
Month
Based on your input, the script will display relevant weather data and generate visualizations.

Example
Here is an example of how to use the script:
```bash
Enter the country: Canada
Enter the season: Winter
Enter the month: December
```
The script will output the weather data for Canada in December during the Winter season and provide a graphical representation of the data.

Code Structure
weather_analysis.py: Main script to handle user input and generate results.
data/: Directory containing CSV files with weather data.
visualizations/: Directory where plots and charts are saved.

### Troubleshooting:
- **Check for Missing Backticks**: Ensure each code block has matching triple backticks before and after it.
- **Add Blank Lines**: Make sure there’s a blank line before and after each code block.
- **Review Markdown Rendering**: If you’re using a Markdown editor or GitHub preview, check how it renders to ensure code blocks and text are displayed correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to ensure that your README displays code blocks and text correctly.
